# 🎓 Open Trivia Quiz App

This is a mini React quiz application built using the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/). It was created as part of the Coding Temple Software Engineering program to demonstrate component architecture, form handling, conditional rendering, and API interaction in React.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Home Page**  
   - User enters their name, selects a category & difficulty.
   - All inputs are validated (must be filled in).
   - On submit, the app fetches one multiple-choice question from the API.

2. **Question Page**  
   - The question and randomized answers are shown via radio buttons.
   - Submitting without selecting an answer displays an error.
   - Based on the answer, a result is generated.

3. **Result Page**  
   - User sees if they got it right or wrong, including the correct answer.
   - A “Back to Start” button lets them try again with new settings.
