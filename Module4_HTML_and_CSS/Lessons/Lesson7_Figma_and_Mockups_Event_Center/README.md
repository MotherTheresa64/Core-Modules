# Lesson 7: Figma and Mockups for Your Event Center Website

## 📌 Overview
In this lesson, you’ll explore the world of wireframing, prototyping, and UI design using **Figma**. You’ll learn how to visualize your Event Center website's layout before writing any code by creating mockups using Figma’s design tools.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 🔲 What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of sketching the layout of a website or app to focus on structure and user flow. It helps teams iterate quickly and communicate design ideas early.

- **Low-Fidelity:** Basic structure using placeholders and minimal design.
- **Medium-Fidelity:** Includes spacing, basic text, and early visual hierarchy.
- **High-Fidelity:** Pixel-perfect with colors, typography, and interaction.

### 🔁 What is Prototyping?
Prototyping creates interactive simulations of the final product. You can test navigation, layout, and usability before development begins.

---

### 🧑‍🎨 What is UI Design?
UI Design focuses on visuals—colors, buttons, typography, and layout consistency. A well-crafted UI improves usability and communicates branding effectively.

## ✍️ What is Figma?

Figma is a browser-based design tool for creating mockups and interactive prototypes. Features include:

## 🎨 Challenge: Event Center Homepage Mockup

Design a homepage mockup that includes:
- A top navigation bar
- Hero banner with title and subtitle
- Welcome message
- "About Us" section
- Bonus: A Featured Events section

> 💡 Tip: Use `R` for rectangles and `T` for text blocks in Figma.

## 📁 Optional Export

You can optionally include your mockup in this folder as:
- `event-center-homepage.png` or
- `event-center-homepage.pdf`

This will serve as the design reference for your **Module 4 Project**.
