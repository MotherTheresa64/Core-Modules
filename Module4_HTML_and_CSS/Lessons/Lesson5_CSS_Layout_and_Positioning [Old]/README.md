## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 🔲 Display Property

- `block`: Takes up the full width (`<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`)
- `inline`: Only as wide as needed (`<span>`, `<a>`)
- `inline-block`: Behaves inline but allows width/height
- `none`: Hides the element

---

### 📍 CSS Positioning

- `static`: Default flow
- `relative`: Adjust from normal position
- `absolute`: Based on nearest positioned ancestor
- `fixed`: Stays in the same place while scrolling
- `sticky`: Sticks to a position when scrolling

---

### 📐 Box Model

- `margin`: Space outside the element
- `border`: Edge of the box
- `padding`: Space inside the box
- `content`: The actual element content

---

### ➿ Flexbox (Intro)

- `display: flex`: Turns container into flexbox
- `justify-content`: Horizontal alignment
- `align-items`: Vertical alignment
- `flex-direction`: Row or column layout

---

### 🔲 Grid (Intro)

- `display: grid`: Defines a grid layout
- `grid-template-columns/rows`: Define structure
- `grid-column` / `grid-row`: Position items
