## 🌐 1. What is the Internet?

The internet is a global network connecting millions of computers, servers, and devices, enabling them to share information. Think of it as the world’s largest postal system, delivering digital "packages" (data) to "addresses" (IP addresses) using standardized rules called **protocols**.

### Key Components

- **Servers** – Store and send website content  
- **Clients** – Your device making the request  
- **Protocols** – HTTP, DNS, etc. that govern communication

## 🧭 2. What is a Browser?

A **browser** (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari) is software that lets users access and interact with websites. It acts as a **translator**, converting raw code into usable visual pages.

### How It Works

1. **Request**: User enters a web address  
2. **Response**: Server sends back web files  
3. **Rendering**: Browser displays the page  

### Key Features

- **Developer Tools** for debugging and inspection  
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility** to ensure consistency across devices
