## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 🌑 Shadows and Text Effects
- `box-shadow`: Adds shadow behind elements.
- `text-shadow`: Applies glow or depth to text.

### 🎨 Transitions
- Smoothly animate style changes (e.g., hover effects).

### 🎞️ Animations
- Use `@keyframes` to define multi-step animations.

### 🧪 CSS Variables
- Store reusable values globally with `--variable-name`.

### 📱 Responsive Design
- Media queries enable layout and style changes at different screen widths.
- Use the `viewport` meta tag to support scaling on mobile.
