# Lesson 5: File Handling in Python

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This lesson introduces file handling in Python: reading, writing, appending, and managing structured data such as lists and dictionaries. Youâ€™ll also build a real-world, interactive TV show manager app using file persistence.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts

- Open and write (`'w'`), append (`'a'`), or read (`'r'`) files
- Use `with open(...)` for safer file management
- Store lists and dictionaries in files
- Build an interactive program for persistent data storage
- Use regex to parse structured data from files

## ðŸ“‚ Included Files

| File                      | Purpose                                                |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `basic_file_operations.py` | Demonstrates reading, writing, and appending to files |
| `favorite_foods_manager.py` | Interactive CLI to manage a list of favorite foods     |
| `structured_data_io.py`    | File input/output for lists and dictionaries           |
| `tv_show_manager.py`       | Full-featured TV show manager with regex and CLI       |
| `tv_show_editor_challenge.py` | Final challenge: edit a show's platform or genre     |
