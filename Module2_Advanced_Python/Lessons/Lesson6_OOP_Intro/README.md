# Lesson 6: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This lesson introduces the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, including classes, objects, attributes, and methods. You'll learn how to build modular and reusable code using encapsulation, and implement real-world models using Python classes.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts

- Define custom classes using the `class` keyword
- Create and initialize objects with `__init__()`
- Use instance vs. class attributes
- Create and invoke instance methods
- Understand OOP principles: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism

## âœ… Learning Outcomes

By completing this lesson, you will:
- Create classes with attributes and methods
- Instantiate objects and interact with their data
- Encapsulate logic inside reusable blueprints
- Build realistic models (e.g., a person, bank account) using OOP
