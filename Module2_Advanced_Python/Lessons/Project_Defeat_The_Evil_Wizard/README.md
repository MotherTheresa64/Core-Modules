# 🧙‍♂️ Module 2 Project: Defeat the Evil Wizard

## 📌 Overview

In this turn-based Python game, you'll create a hero character using Object-Oriented Programming principles and face off against an evil wizard. You'll implement a battle system, create custom abilities, and manage game logic using classes, inheritance, and methods.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

- Class creation and inheritance
- Encapsulation and attribute management
- Turn-based menu systems
- Randomized combat logic
- Game state management with objects

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:

- Create classes with special and inherited methods
- Use encapsulation to manage character health and stats
- Develop a working turn-based CLI game
- Practice using randomness and control flow to influence outcomes
- Build toward more scalable game logic using object-oriented design
