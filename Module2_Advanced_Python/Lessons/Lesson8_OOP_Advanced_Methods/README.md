# Lesson 8: Advanced OOP Methods (Optional)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This optional lesson explores advanced class features in Python OOP: special (dunder) methods like `__repr__` and `__str__`, `@classmethod` for class-level behavior, and `@staticmethod` for utility functions. These tools provide more control, flexibility, and expressiveness in object-oriented design.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts

- **__repr__ vs __str__**: Debug vs user-friendly string output
- **@classmethod**: Operate at the class level (e.g., alternative constructors)
- **@staticmethod**: Attach utility functions to classes that don't modify or depend on instance/class state

## âœ… Learning Outcomes

By completing this lesson, you will:
- Customize how your objects are printed or represented in code
- Use class methods for alternative constructors and shared class logic
- Use static methods for reusable, context-related utility functions
