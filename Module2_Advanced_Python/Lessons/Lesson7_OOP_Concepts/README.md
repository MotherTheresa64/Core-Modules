# Lesson 7: Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This lesson explores the four pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. You'll learn how to define your own classes and objects and understand public, protected, and private attributes, as well as how to reuse and extend functionality using inheritance and method overriding.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts

- Class vs. Object
- Instance attributes vs. class attributes
- The `__init__()` constructor method
- Access modifiers: public, protected, private
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Polymorphism using shared method names
- Multiple inheritance and the diamond problem

## âœ… Learning Outcomes

By completing this lesson, you will:
- Use `__init__()` to define attributes
- Control attribute visibility with public, protected, and private modifiers
- Inherit and override methods in subclasses
- Use polymorphism to abstract behavior across classes
- Understand multiple inheritance and method resolution order
