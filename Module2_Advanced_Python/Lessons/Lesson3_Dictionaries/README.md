# Lesson 3: Dictionaries in Python

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Dictionaries are mutable collections of key-value pairs that allow for fast, flexible data access. Theyâ€™re ideal for storing structured data such as user records, configuration settings, and grouped data like inventories or profiles.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts

- **Access** values via keys
- Use `.get()` to avoid errors on missing keys
- **Add, modify, or delete** elements dynamically
- Loop through `.keys()`, `.values()`, or `.items()`
- Nest dictionaries, lists, and combinations
- Store multiple records as a list of dictionaries

## âœ… Learning Outcomes

By completing this lesson, you can:
- Build and manipulate flat and nested dictionaries
- Use key-access safely with `.get()`
- Iterate through dictionaries for processing
- Work with real-world dictionary structures (e.g., student records, inventories)
