# Lesson 3: Intro to ORMs

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This lesson introduces Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), which allows Python developers to interact with relational databases using object-oriented syntax. You'll learn how to define models, perform basic CRUD operations, and represent relationships between tables using SQLAlchemy 2.0.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts

- What is an ORM and why use one
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 setup and virtual environments
- Defining models as Python classes
- Performing CRUD operations using SQLAlchemy sessions
- One-to-Many and Many-to-Many relationships with SQLAlchemy
