# 🧠 Lesson 7: Using AI to Build and Test RESTful APIs with Confidence

## 📌 Overview
As a backend developer, RESTful APIs are one of the most important tools in your toolbox. This lesson shows you how to use AI—like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot—to speed up API development with Flask and SQLAlchemy. From writing clean route handlers to debugging errors and testing endpoints, you’ll learn how to build APIs faster and smarter using AI as your assistant.

## 🚀 Key Concepts
- Scaffold CRUD endpoints using AI prompts or code suggestions
- Debug SQLAlchemy and Flask errors with AI explanations
- Test endpoints with AI-assisted test case generation
- Learn to describe desired behavior to AI for more useful responses

## 💡 Use Cases
- User registration and login APIs
- Order placement and product inventory updates
- Testing endpoint behaviors and failure scenarios
- Real-time data interaction between front end and backend services

| `orders_api.py`      | Flask app for handling user orders with SQLAlchemy and validation  |
| `test_orders_api.py` | Unit tests for the API using Flask’s test client                   |
| `ai_prompt_examples.txt` | Sample prompts used with AI tools to scaffold and debug the API       |

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Write Flask route handlers using AI-generated scaffolds
- Interpret and resolve API and database errors with AI support
- Build unit tests with AI guidance to verify API behavior
- Simulate real-world backend tasks and debugging workflows

## 🧪 Sample Prompts to Try
- `"How do I create a Flask POST route for adding a user to a database?"`
- `"Why am I getting a NOT NULL constraint failed error from SQLAlchemy?"`
- `"Write a test case for a route that creates an order using Flask's test client."`
- `"How can I ensure duplicate emails return an error instead of creating a user?"`

## 🧩 Mini-Project: Orders API
Your objective is to build and test a Flask API with AI support:

- **POST /orders**: Create a new order for a user.
- Validate the user and product(s) exist.
- Return order details and ID in the response.

Bonus:
- Ask AI how to write a test that ensures the order is valid and stored correctly.
- Write a second test that simulates an invalid or missing user.

## ✅ Final Takeaways
- AI can scaffold endpoints, generate tests, and explain tricky bugs.
- Asking clear questions helps AI give better guidance—an essential skill in dev teams.
- You now think and build like a backend engineer, using modern AI tooling to stay efficient.
