# Lesson 5: Building RESTful APIs with Flask

## Overview
This lesson teaches you how to create a RESTful API using Flask, SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow, and MySQL. You will build models with a many-to-many relationship and create full CRUD API endpoints for `User` and `Pet` resources.

## Key Concepts
- RESTful API design
- Flask + SQLAlchemy ORM
- Marshmallow for serialization and validation
- CRUD functionality
- Many-to-many relationships
- Testing endpoints with Postman

## Included Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `app.py` | Main application file containing Flask app, models, schemas, and routes |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies needed for the virtual environment |
| `README.md` | This file |

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Set up a Flask REST API connected to a MySQL database
- Define models with relationships using SQLAlchemy
- Validate and serialize data using Flask-Marshmallow
- Perform CRUD operations through RESTful endpoints
- Test your API using tools like Postman
